Segurança Informática em Redes e Sistemas/ Network and Computer Security

This was my first Project in java before knowing anything about Threads, Sockets or Objects. 

I learned by myself and with some friends and this was the final result.



10. Secure Smart Home
The Internet of Things is a technology trend where all useful devices can get connected to the Internet and allow for data collection and remote control. Some illustrative examples of such devices are smart locks, thermostats, smart appliances (e.g. fridge, washing machine).
In this work, you should consider how to implement the management console for a smart home system. Moreover, you should consider the secure design of the network (e.g., firewall) to control the data flows.
The privacy of the home owner should also be safeguarded. For example, it is necessary to ensure that the collected data is only shared outside the home with the explicit consent of the owner.
